# Implementation of various Deep Reinforcement Learning Algorithms on various environments with Pytorch
This repository contains well documented code for various environments

## Environments covered:
- [x] CartPole with DQN
- [x] Lunar Lander with ActorCritic
- [x] Simple Spread MultiAgent ENvironment with MADDPG
- [x] PyBullet's Continuous space environments like Half-Humanoid, Half-cheetah and Ant with Twin Delayed DDPG
- [x] Navigate an agent in an unknown environment with DQN
